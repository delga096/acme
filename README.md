ACME School

For this PoC I decided to make a solution using Visual Studio and the last .NET version.
There are two projects, the class library and the test unit.
The first one is developed using the Layered Architecture and the Repository Pattern in order to achieve the evaluation points.
For the second I considered using NSubstitute due to the abstractions needed in the Service Layer.
I would have like to make a better set up for the tests, this will be useful for the project if it increases.
I invested a lot of time trying to make the best solution. The tests were not something that I have made for previous projects so I passed many hours watching videos and of course using an AI to help me.
